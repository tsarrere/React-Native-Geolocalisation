# React-Native-Geolocalisation
This mobile app was developed using React Native and the Expo framework.
It shows a map of the location of the school where I studied for my degree in multimedia and internet studies, on which I overlaped a png image showing the plan of the building. There are also pins showing some places of interest in the building, and a marker displays in real time where you are located.
